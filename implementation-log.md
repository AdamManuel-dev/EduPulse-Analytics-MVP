## Summary

### Completed Tasks: 5/5 Environment & Infrastructure Tasks
### Time Taken: ~30 minutes
### Next Steps: Database Setup Tasks (DB-001 through DB-003)

## Key Achievements

1. **Project Structure**: Created a well-organized, scalable project structure following Python best practices
2. **Development Environment**: Set up Python 3.12 virtual environment with all necessary dependencies
3. **Code Quality**: Implemented pre-commit hooks with multiple linters and formatters
4. **Containerization**: Created Docker configurations for both development and production with CUDA support
5. **Configuration Management**: Implemented type-safe configuration using Pydantic with comprehensive settings

## Technical Decisions

- Used Python 3.12 for latest features and performance improvements
- Selected FastAPI for modern async API development
- Chose TimescaleDB for efficient time-series data handling
- Implemented Celery with Redis for scalable async task processing
- Used Pydantic for robust data validation and settings management

## Files Created

- **Configuration**: .env.example, pyproject.toml, .flake8, .pre-commit-config.yaml
- **Docker**: Dockerfile, docker/Dockerfile.base, docker-compose.yml, .dockerignore
- **Python**: requirements.txt, requirements-dev.txt, src/config/settings.py
- **Documentation**: README.md (updated)
- **Git**: .gitignore

All environment and infrastructure tasks have been successfully completed. The project now has a solid foundation for development.
