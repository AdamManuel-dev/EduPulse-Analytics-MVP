# EduPulse Analytics MVP - Development Session Summary

## Date: August 13, 2025

## 🎯 Objectives Completed

This session successfully established the foundation for the EduPulse Analytics MVP, a temporal ML system for K-12 student success monitoring.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Environment Setup
- ✓ Created Python virtual environment with Python 3.12
- ✓ Installed all required dependencies (PyTorch, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, etc.)
- ✓ Updated package versions for compatibility (torch 2.5.1, numpy 1.26.4)
- ✓ Configured environment variables in .env file

### 2. Database Infrastructure
- ✓ Set up PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB extension via Docker
- ✓ Created comprehensive database schema with:
  - Students table with metadata support
  - Time-series student_features hypertable
  - Predictions tracking with risk factors
  - Training feedback for continuous learning
  - Attendance, grades, and discipline incident tables
  - Model metadata tracking
  - Materialized view for risk summaries
- ✓ Configured proper indexes for query optimization
- ✓ Implemented database connection pooling

### 3. Data Models & Validation
- ✓ Created SQLAlchemy ORM models for all database tables
- ✓ Implemented Pydantic schemas for:
  - Request/response validation
  - Data serialization
  - API documentation
- ✓ Fixed model configuration issues (CheckConstraint ordering)
- ✓ Established proper relationships between entities

### 4. API Development

- ✓ Implemented core API endpoints:
  - Health and readiness checks
  - Student CRUD operations
  - Single and batch prediction endpoints (mock)
  - Training update endpoints
  - Model metrics endpoint
- ✓ Configured CORS middleware
- ✓ Integrated Prometheus metrics
- ✓ Set up proper routing and API versioning

### 5. Project Structure
- ✓ Organized code into logical modules
- ✓ Created proper package structure
- ✓ Set up configuration management with Pydantic Settings
- ✓ Implemented database session management
- ✓ Created test setup verification script

### 6. Documentation
- ✓ Updated README with setup instructions
- ✓ Documented API endpoints
- ✓ Created comprehensive PRD and TODO files
- ✓ Added inline documentation

## 🚧 Next Steps (Ready for Implementation)

Based on the TODO.md file, the following tasks are ready to begin:

### High Priority
1. **Feature Engineering Pipeline** (FEAT-001 to FEAT-008)
   - Implement attendance, grade, and discipline feature extractors
   - Create feature caching with Redis
   - Build feature validation system

2. **ML Model Implementation** (ML-001 to ML-008)
   - Build PyTorch GRU model with attention
   - Implement model quantization
   - Create interpretation utilities

3. **Training Pipeline** (TRAIN-001 to TRAIN-011)
   - Create PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader
   - Implement training loop with early stopping
   - Add MLflow integration for tracking

### Medium Priority
1. **Async Processing** (ASYNC-001 to ASYNC-006)
   - Set up Celery workers
   - Implement async prediction tasks
   - Create task status tracking

2. **Testing Suite** (TEST-001 to TEST-011)
   - Write unit tests for all components
   - Create integration tests
   - Implement load testing

3. **Performance Optimization** (PERF-001 to PERF-004)
   - Add response compression
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching strategies

## 📊 Current Status

### Working Components
- PostgreSQL and Redis services (via Docker)
- Basic API structure (can be started with uvicorn)
- Database schema fully created
- Model definitions complete

### Pending Components
- Actual ML model implementation
- Feature extraction logic
- Real prediction functionality
- Training pipeline
- Production deployment configuration

## 🛠️ Technical Decisions Made

1. **Database**: PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for efficient time-series handling
2. **API Framework**: FastAPI for modern async Python API
3. **ML Framework**: PyTorch for GRU implementation
4. **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis for async processing
5. **Monitoring**: Prometheus for metrics collection
6. **Testing**: Pytest for comprehensive testing

## 📝 Notes for Next Session

1. The API currently returns mock predictions - this needs to be replaced with actual ML logic
2. Database connections are configured for local development
3. All infrastructure is containerized for easy deployment
4. The project follows Python best practices with type hints and validation

## 🎉 Success Metrics

- ✅ All database tables created successfully
- ✅ API endpoints responding (with mock data)
- ✅ Development environment fully configured
- ✅ Project structure established for team collaboration
- ✅ Documentation updated for onboarding
