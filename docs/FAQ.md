# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is EduPulse Analytics?

EduPulse Analytics is an AI-powered student dropout risk prediction system that helps educational institutions identify at-risk students early and provide timely interventions. It uses machine learning to analyze attendance, academic performance, and behavioral patterns.

### How accurate are the predictions?

The system achieves approximately 89% accuracy in predicting dropout risk, with an AUC-ROC score of 0.917. Performance varies by risk category:
- Low risk: 91% accuracy
- Medium risk: 80% accuracy  
- High risk: 76% accuracy
- Critical risk: 81% accuracy

### What data is required?

The system requires:
- Student demographics (age, grade level, enrollment date)
- Attendance records (daily attendance status)
- Academic grades (assignments, tests, GPA)
- Disciplinary incidents (optional but improves accuracy)

## Technical Questions

### What technology stack is used?

- **Backend**: Python 3.9+, FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **ML Framework**: PyTorch
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes-ready

### What are the system requirements?

**Minimum Requirements:**
- 4 CPU cores
- 8GB RAM
- 50GB storage
- PostgreSQL 12+
- Redis 6+

**Recommended for Production:**
- 8+ CPU cores
- 16GB+ RAM
- 100GB+ SSD storage

### How do I scale the system?

The system is designed for horizontal scaling:
1. API servers can be load-balanced
2. Database can use read replicas
3. Redis can be clustered
4. ML inference can be distributed

## API Questions

### How do I authenticate with the API?

The API uses JWT token authentication:
```python
# Login to get token
response = requests.post('/auth/login', json={
    'username': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password'
})
token = response.json()['access_token']

# Use token in requests
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
response = requests.get('/api/v1/students', headers=headers)
```

### What are the rate limits?

Default rate limits:
- 100 requests per minute per IP
- 1000 requests per hour per user
- Batch endpoints: 10 requests per minute

### Can I get real-time predictions?

Yes, the API provides:
- Single student predictions: < 200ms response time
- Batch predictions: < 2 seconds for 100 students
- WebSocket support for real-time updates

## Data & Privacy Questions

### How is student data protected?

- All data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS)
- Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Audit logging for all data access
- FERPA compliant data handling

### Can I export my data?

Yes, the system supports:
- CSV export of all predictions
- JSON export for API integration
- Bulk data download via API
- Scheduled reports

### How long is data retained?

Default retention policies:
- Predictions: 2 years
- Student records: 7 years
- Audit logs: 1 year
- Training data: Indefinite (anonymized)

## Model Questions

### How often is the model retrained?

- Automatic retraining: Quarterly
- Performance-triggered: When accuracy drops below 85%
- Manual retraining: On-demand via API

### What features are most important?

Top 5 features by importance:
1. Attendance rate (last 30 days) - 15.2%
2. Current GPA - 9.8%
3. Consecutive absences - 8.7%
4. Discipline incidents - 7.4%
5. Homework completion rate - 6.8%

### Can I customize the model?

Yes, you can:
- Adjust risk thresholds
- Weight specific features
- Add custom features
- Train on your specific data

## Integration Questions

### How do I integrate with my SIS?

The system provides:
- REST API for all operations
- Batch import endpoints
- CSV/Excel import tools
- Database direct connection options

Example integrations available for:
- PowerSchool
- Infinite Campus
- Canvas LMS
- Google Classroom

### Is there a mobile app?

Not currently, but the API is mobile-ready:
- RESTful API works with any mobile framework
- WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Responsive web dashboard (coming soon)

### Can I embed predictions in my application?

Yes, through:
- REST API integration
- JavaScript SDK (community-maintained)
- Python client library
- Webhook notifications

## Troubleshooting Questions

### Why are predictions failing?

Common causes:
1. Missing required student data
2. Insufficient historical data (< 30 days)
3. Model not loaded properly
4. Database connection issues

### How do I improve prediction accuracy?

1. Ensure complete data collection
2. Add more historical data (90+ days ideal)
3. Include all feature categories
4. Regular model retraining
5. Clean and validate input data

### What if the system is slow?

Performance optimization steps:
1. Check database indexes
2. Increase Redis cache size
3. Enable query result caching
4. Scale API servers horizontally
5. Optimize feature extraction queries

## Common Error Messages

### "Insufficient data for prediction"

The student needs at least 30 days of historical data. Wait for more data collection or use fallback predictions.

### "Model not found"

The ML model hasn't been trained yet. Run:
```bash
python -m src.training.trainer train --initial
```

### "Rate limit exceeded"

You've exceeded API rate limits. Wait 60 seconds or upgrade your plan for higher limits.

### "Invalid feature vector"

Input data validation failed. Check:
- All required fields are present
- Date formats are correct
- Numeric values are in valid ranges
