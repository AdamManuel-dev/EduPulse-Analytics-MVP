### 6. Student Simulation Profiles

#### Profile Types
1. **High Achiever**
   - Submits assignments early
   - High engagement with materials
   - Consistent login patterns
   - Performance: 85-95%

2. **Struggling Student**
   - Late submissions
   - Sporadic engagement
   - Seeks help frequently
   - Performance: 55-70%

3. **Average Performer**
   - On-time submissions
   - Regular engagement
   - Performance: 70-85%

4. **At-Risk Student**
   - Missing assignments
   - Declining engagement
   - Performance: Below 60%

5. **Non-Traditional Student**
   - Evening/weekend activity
   - Burst learning patterns
   - Variable performance

### 7. Metrics to Collect
- Response times per endpoint
- Database query execution times
- ML model prediction accuracy
- Memory usage patterns
- CPU utilization
- Network bandwidth usage
- WebSocket message latency
- Cache hit rates
- Error rates by category

### 8. Test Execution & Verification
- [ ] Run unit test suite with coverage report
- [ ] Execute e2e test scenarios
- [ ] Run performance benchmarks
- [ ] Generate test reports
- [ ] Document any skipped/failing tests
- [ ] Create CI/CD integration

## Priority Levels
- **HIGH**: Unit tests for core functionality, Authentication e2e tests
- **MEDIUM**: Data generation scripts, Student simulations
- **LOW**: Performance optimizations, Extended analytics tests

## Success Criteria
- Unit test coverage > 80%
- All critical user paths covered by e2e tests
- Performance benchmarks established
- Student simulations produce statistically realistic patterns
- No critical bugs in core workflows

## Notes
- Use faker.js or similar for realistic data generation
- Implement test fixtures for consistent test data
- Use Jest for unit tests, Playwright/Cypress for e2e tests
- Performance tests should run in isolated environment
- Document any assumptions about system behavior
